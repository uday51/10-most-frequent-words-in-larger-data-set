# Large Text File Processor (CPU-Friendly)

This Python script processes large text files efficiently using **CPU-friendly** techniques. It reads the file line by line, tokenizes words, and counts their frequencies without consuming excessive memory.

## ðŸš€ Features
- âœ… **Handles large files** without loading them fully into memory.
- âœ… **Uses regex-based tokenization** for accurate word extraction.
- âœ… **Optimized for CPU** (avoids GPU-based libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch).
- âœ… **Outputs top 10 most frequent words** from the file.
